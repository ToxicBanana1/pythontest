The color that doesn’t truly exist
It has no place in the light spectrum’s list
A common look within the world of fish
A world we can’t explore, despite my wish

Though purple may be a common color
When overused, It begins to seem duller
But there’s also this man, cloaked in a chicken costume
Though we cannot see him, as he always leaves in a zoom

This unusual man, always saving the day
But within his presence, something seems amay
Though some say he may be a foe
Due to his selfless acts, to him we truly owe

Now let's get back, to the topic of this illusion
We need an explanation, to clear this confusion
Within the spectrum of color, it has its right
But the same cannot be said about that of the light

Now as this text is brought to conclusion
Might I remind you, purple is but an illusion
Now as these statements are to be dismissed
Purple is a color, That doesn’t truly exist
